Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?
The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.
And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.
And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
